# GitHub User Search

This application consumes the GitHub API to fetch user profiles from the platform. It features a dynamic search functionality and profile details for navigation. The app locally stores data downloaded from the API in a Room database so it can still be viewed without an Internet connection.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **User Search**: Filter GitHub users in real-time using a search bar.
- **Profile Details**: View comprehensive GitHub user profile information, including repositories and followers.
- **Offline Mode**: Access previously downloaded data without an internet connection.
- **Modern Interface**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a smooth and interactive UI.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network failures and empty states.
- **Pagination Support**: Efficiently loads large datasets using paging.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The key reasons for choosing MVVM include:

- **Separation of concerns**: UI logic is separate from business logic.
- **Improved testability**: ViewModel can be tested independently of the UI.
- **Better lifecycle awareness**: ViewModel survives configuration changes.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Minimum SDK**: Level 24
- **Language**: Kotlin with Coroutines + Flow for asynchronous operations
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: MVVM
